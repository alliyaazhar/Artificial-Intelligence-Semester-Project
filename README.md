# 🧠 Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This is an Artificial Intelligence project that uses machine learning algorithms to predict diseases based on input symptoms. Two models were trained and evaluated to determine which one performs better in terms of accuracy.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a simple but effective AI system that can predict diseases based on symptoms using supervised learning models and compare their performance.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File Name**: `Training.csv`
- **File Name**: `Testing.csv`

## 📊 Features

- Symptom-based prediction
- No data preprocessing required (the dataset is clean with no missing values)
- Model comparison using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

## ⚙️ Models Trained

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model was trained on the same dataset and tested using evaluation metrics to determine the better-performing algorithm.
